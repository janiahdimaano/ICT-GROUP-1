</head>
<body>Grade 10 holds a special place in my memory, filled with moments of growth, challenges, and difficulties that taught me valuable lessons, those experiences shaped my journey and why would I forget our kind and supportive teacher? Mr eugene saguirer he's the one who taught us to be more discipline, he's the one who guide us. Those created memories from grade 10 Poseidon 2023-2024 is the chapter I will hold dear in my heart.The experience I had this school year was that I felt nervous during the first quarter because we were immediately guided for the monthly exam, and I also felt happy because of my classmates, and the school year is almost over.The experience I felt this school year is Nervous because I think this grade level will be difficult to me  and Happy because i will graduate to jhs With the feeling Scared because this the first step to my Goal.The memories that I will not forget now that I am a grade 10 student is that I made friends and I met them and I met kind teachers who taught us well and laughed with us and in the year 2023-2024 I became an honor student, even though many trials came but it can still handle the guidance of my friends and teachers at school.
